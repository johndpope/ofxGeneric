//  There are two major steps to payments:
//  1) Send our product IDs to the app store and request back the actual products. Then display the products..
//  2) After the user has chosen to purchase a product, send a payment request to the app store.
//
//  Specific steps are:
//  1) Get the app IDs from either the server or just a file somewhere.
//  2) Send the IDs to the app store
//  3) The app store sends back products
//  4) Get the products and display the store page to the user with them
//  5) The user chooses to purchase an item
//  6) Send a payment request to the app store
//  7) The app store processes the payment, then sends back a transaction receipt
//  8) Get the transaction receipt and send it to the server in order to give credit
//  9) The server gives credit, sends an OK back to the client
//  10) The client sends a completed transaction call back to the app store to wrap things up
